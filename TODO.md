+ __function to retrieve character info from API__
  - takes character name from quotes.json

+ __make logic branch whether or not cache exists__
  - if not exist, get from API and cache
  - I guess in all cases it will be ultimately reading from the cache
  - maybe add the feature to force reading from API

+ __split things out from util files__

+ __make sure caching worked__

+ __build an express endpoint__

+ __translate character names to format used in API__
  - maybe use aliases?

## FINISHED ##
